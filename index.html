  <p>I decided to take programming classes at Moringa school because my programming skills were a bit rusty since I rarely coded after I finished my degree cause.I was to refresh my programming skills independently but I realised that it would take me a long time to learn due to my day job. I thought it would be better if I joined a learning institution where I would learn more in a short. I decided to check out Moringa school's website to see the part-time programming courses they offer. When I went through the course outline on the website, I noticed that they offered Git and markdown which I never learnt before. This caused me to pick Moringa school as my learning institution. Thus far am in a position to say that I am enjoying the classes.

  <h3>Interests and hobbies</h3>
  <p>I am very interested in coding. I have also developed an interest in reading novels especially books written by Sydney Sheldon and Haruki Murakami. I love to travel a lot! </p>
