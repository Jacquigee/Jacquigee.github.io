  <p>I decided to take programming classes at Moringa school because my programming skills were a bit rusty since I rarely coded after I finished my degree cause.I was to refresh my learning skill independently but i ralised that it would take me a long time to learn due to my day job. I decided that it would be better if I joined a learning institution where I would learn more in a short. I decided to check out Moringa school's website to see the part-time programming corses they offer. When I went through the course outline on the website, I noticed that they offered Git, commandline and markdown which I never learnt before. This caused me to pick Moringa school as my learning institution.</p>
